# Introduction: Northshore Constitution

### What is the Northshore Constitution?

The Northshore Constitution documents the core rules, structure, and processes of the Holacracy framework for governing and managing an organization. It provides the foundation needed for Holacracy practice, by anchoring the target power shift in concrete and documented “rules of the game”.

### What the Northshore Constitution isn’t
The Northshore Constitution is **not a complete set of legal bylaws or a formal operating agreement**.

The Constitution is also **not an instruction manual or a guidebook** for learning to use the Holacracy framework. Like the rulebook for a sport, it can serve as a critical reference at times, but reading it will not teach you how to play the game.

### Licensing and Usage
The Northshore costitution is derived from the official Hoacracy Constitution which may be found at http://holacracy.org/constitution.
